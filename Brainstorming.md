Verdict: Weather App is the Easiest to Build
Why?
One clear, free, well-documented API (OpenWeatherMap)

Simple RecyclerView usage (forecast cards or hourly data)

Basic UI: city search, weather icon, temp, description

Can add features incrementally (UV index, humidity, forecast)

ü•à Second Place: Movie Suggestion App
Also beginner-friendly

Slightly more complex because of poster images, genres, ratings

TMDB API requires account + key, but very usable

ü•â Third Place: Travel Tour App
Hardest due to:

Needing multiple APIs (e.g., Google Places, Maps, Unsplash)

Managing geo-coordinates, navigation, maybe maps

Better for advanced projects

| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mobile**   | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium. Feels like a mobile-optimized Netflix browser. UI is clean and swipeable but could exist on web too.         |
| **Story**    | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Clear: ‚ÄúGet fresh movie ideas when you don‚Äôt know what to watch.‚Äù Great for social sharing.                         |
| **Market**   | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Huge! Anyone who watches movies is a potential user. Highly relatable problem (decision fatigue).                   |
| **Habit**    | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium. Use spikes during weekends or boredom. Less daily usage unless personalized.                                 |
| **Scope**    | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Clear MVP: fetch popular/trending movies, display in cards, click to see details. Easy to extend (genres, ratings). |
